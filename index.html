                 I worked with Anthony trying to hit my mark recording video intros and lectures for the hybrid course I was developing for U of Toronto SCS. Anthony is a talented producer/director/cameraman who brings out the best in people and knows how to make the 'talent' feel comfortable, relaxed and happy - regardless of how many takes I had to do.

                During the Winter 0f 2014, Anthony was engaged as the facilitator of the video recordings of presentations I made for two online courses that I teach at the University of Toronto, School of Continuing Studies . In total it was 30, one hour to one and a half hour sessions, each.  I was very impressed with the work Anthony provided that included, visual and audio setup, presentation coaching, and editing of recordings. He is very knowledgeable, professional, and engaging.

                I first met Anthony during the summer of 2013. He produced and directed two sets of videos for me. One series was a collaboration between The Chinese University Of Hong Kong CUSCS and The University of Toronto's  SCS.  Anthony's  commitment to his craft is impressive to say the least. He was easy to work with and quick to ease any concerns I had about the recording process. I found him to be very professional and I would recommend his services.
